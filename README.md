# Fraud Detection Model

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning. We clean data, handle outliers, and build a predictive model to identify fraud patterns. Metrics like precision and recall evaluate the model, and the project provides recommendations for proactive fraud prevention.

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook

### Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model building.
- `models/`: Saved models for fraud detection.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project.

### Installation
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost statsmodels
```

### Data Cleaning

**Handling Missing Values**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Impute missing values with the mean
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
```

**Handling Outliers**
```python
# Calculate the first quartile (25th percentile)
Q1 = df['amount'].quantile(0.25)

# Calculate the third quartile (75th percentile)
Q3 = df['amount'].quantile(0.75)

# Calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

# Remove outliers
df = df[(df['amount'] >= (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) & (df['amount'] <= (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))]
```

**Check for Multi-Collinearity**
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate the correlation matrix
corr = df.corr()

# Plot the heatmap of the correlation matrix
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True)
plt.show()
```

### Feature Selection
```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

# Define features and target variable
X = df[['amount', 'oldbalanceOrg', 'newbalanceOrig', 'oldbalanceDest', 'newbalanceDest']]
y = df['isFraud']

# Initialize and train the model
model = XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)
```

### Model Building and Evaluation
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Print confusion matrix and classification report
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Prevention and Evaluation
- Recommend implementing fraud detection measures and updating infrastructure.
- Monitor performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Track improvements and adjust strategies as needed.
